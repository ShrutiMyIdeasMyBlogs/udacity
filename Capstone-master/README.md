# Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project
    This project is the final project for my Udacity FullStack Developer Nanodegree.

The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

This Application does not have a frontend implemented. It is a server only application at the moment.

## Application Heroku Link

## Application Stack

The Application Tech Stack includes:
- **Python3**: The [server language](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Flask**: [Server Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- **PostgreSQL**: [Database](https://www.postgresql.org/) of choice
- **SQLAlchemy**: [ORM of choice](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to communicate between the python server and the Postgres Database. [Flask SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) is directly used.
- **Heroku**: [Deployment Platform](https://www.heroku.com/)
- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**: Testing the Application Endpoints
